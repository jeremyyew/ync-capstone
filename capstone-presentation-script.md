# Capstone Presentation Script: *Editorial Support for the Coq Proof Assistant*

# Critique of working title
- "Editorial" emphasizes a property about the efficient cause, i.e. the fact that the syntax checker program is integrated into a text editor, without being specific about the tool itself ('something that supports the editing process in some way'). 
- Efficient cause may not be essential anyway since the project wouldn't be very different if the syntax checker wasn't integrated with the editor. 
- Also anyone unfamiliar with proof assistants will not make the link between Coq Proof Assistant and 'editorial' - who knows how a proof assistant works, or what it produces? 
- Although, 'Editorial' is also nice since it highlights the fact that the support happens throughout the editing (proof-writing) process. 
- 'Support' is good because it conveys the secondary nature of the assistance. 
- But 'Support for the Coq Proof Assistant' places emphasis on the (specific) tool as opposed to the activity/learning process - most listeners might be unfamiliar with the variety of proof assistants/the concept of mechanical proofs, so the specificity is missing context. 
- Also, we are not really supporting Coq, but supporting Coq users.

# Possible new titles
- *Enforcing good form in formal proof-writing* (Too much assonance.)
- *Enforcing good form in proof-writing* (Is proof-writing not specific enough? Still too much assonance.)
- *Training good form in proof-writing* ('Training good form' isn't a very natural phrase.)

# Final: To what end is the data changed? 
To train students to write proofs with greater mindfulness and understanding, ultimately equipping them to tackle logical problems with clarity and confidence.
