# Capstone Proposal  
Student:
Supervisor: 
Title: 
Subject Areas: 

Challenges: The Supervisor’s perception of aspects of this project may disagree with how students perceive it (e.g. numerous abstract proofs or advanced coding skills could affect the completion of the project). Such challenges should be carefully discussed towards finding a consensus between students and Supervisors.

Scope: The primary aim of the project is to contribute to the student’s intellectual development. Likewise, for a project associated to an internship, the Supervisor needs to ensure that the student’s education is paramount. Joint publications with the supervisor resulting from the project are encouraged, but they should not be obtained at the expense of the primary aim.

Expectations associated with grade achievement: Students should be informed about what kind of material the thesis should contain in order to lead to an A- grade. The prerequisites, the co-requisites, and the initial references must be made clear from the beginning.  

Time allocation: Typically, supervision occupies about 1 contact hour weekly or every other week (with considerable week-to-week variation and depending on supervisor). Contact time should not consist of lectures by the Supervisor. It is more profitable to have Q & A between Supervisor and student, with both asking/answering questions.
