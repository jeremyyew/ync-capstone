\section{A skilled discipline}
The learning philosophy of FPP is that programming and proving is similar to training in any skilled discipline such as martial arts, cooking, or dance: beginner training should build muscle memory for basic skills and habits. 

For example, if you are training to be a chef, but you don't develop proper knife skills early on, this will hurt you for the rest of your career. 

Therefore, in the first half of the course, students complete rigorous, progressive exercises in order to practice specific proof techniques and programming habits. In the second half of the course, students can then rely on this muscle memory to write proofs with greater creativity and efficiency. By the end of the course, students will have independently written more proofs than they have ever written in their lives, and all of these proofs would have been verified by Coq.
