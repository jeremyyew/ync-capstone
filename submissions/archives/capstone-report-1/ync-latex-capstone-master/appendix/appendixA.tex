\section{An example grammar}

Here is an example grammar that I might use as input to either a custom parser or a parser generator. It is a subset of Coq's grammar. 

Note that the grammar is incomplete, and does not yet implement any of the rules described. The example is more a demonstration of an exploratory exercise to identify the relevant grammar definitions from various separate grammar specifications in the Coq documentation ("The Gallina specification language", "Terms of the calculus of inductive construction", "The tactic language", and "Atomic tactics").

The notation "..." means any string.
